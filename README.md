I. Easy Money, the End Product

Easy Money is a fundraising system that removes a lot of the stress and work associated with traditional fundraisers.  There is no product to sell, no talking with strangers, no major time commitment for very little financial reward. Instead, students/members compile lists of names, email addresses, and phone numbers of contacts with whom they have a relationship. Whether it be family members, close friends, colleagues, or co-workers, members should be encouraged only to collect this information from people with whom they are familiar, and who are accustomed to hearing from them.

II. This page
This page is the main page for the sponsor/coach/director to interact with his group's donations and data.

The form located in the first six input fields contains fields where they can manually input a new student's information. The first five inputs are self-explanatory, and the sixth field is customizable for a given organization. This particular implementation is for a band organization, so the sixth field allows the director to group their members into instrument sub-groups.the director/coach can keep track of which members are achieving the group's goals. All of the inputs will be stored as objects in the database. 

The second section, below the form, are three other tools, to allow the organizer to quickly see information either about a particular student (the first tool), show a sub-groups total (second tool), or simply see which members have sold the most to date (third tool-button).

Last, this page has a simple refresh button, which will allow the organizer to start from a clean slate.


III. Future functionality 
The ability for a director to input donations manually into this page will become important, as students can drop off money at any time.  These can then simply be added to the database, in a given student's object.

Easy Money has the functionality to notify prospective donors via text message or email (or both!) that the time for donation is coming. The sponsor/coach can set the parameters for how frequently-and how far in advance-these notifications will be sent. A message can be included in the donation request, as to who the organization is making the request, and why they are in need of assistance.

Easy money will also have the functionality to facilitate electronic transactions.  All money donated through whatever means will stored in the database.
